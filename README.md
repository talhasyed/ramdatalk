# Ramdajs Talk

Ramdajs is a functional utility library.

In this talk will start with a very brief intro to Ramdajs before we delve into looking at an example of using Ramda to manipulate data for a common API controller type use case.

## Setup

Please have `typescript` and `ts-node` installed by your preferred Node package manager.

To execute the examples, run:

```
ts-node/src/1-in30s.ts
```

And so on.
