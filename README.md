# Ramdajs Talk

In this talk will start with a very brief intro to Ramdajs (a functional utility library). We will then delve into looking at an example of using Ramda to manipulate data for a common API controller type use case.

## Setup

Please install `typescript` and `ts-node` with your preferred Node package manager.

## Running the examples

To execute the examples, run:

```
ts-node src/1-in30s.ts
ts-node src/2.1-fullTimers.ts
...
```

And so on.
